# N-Queens-Problem, Sunway University Artificial Intelligence Final Assignment

Task: 
- You are asked to identify (if existed) the placement of eight queens on an 8-by-8 chess board such that no queen is able to remove
other queens.


Created a solution for the N-Queens problem using the backtracking algorithm

Running the code : 
- Input the number of queens required for the program 
- Run the code
- A text-based visualisation of the board with the solution is displayed
- (-) represents the empty cells on the board
- (Q) represents the Queens
- You are only allowed to input integer values and the value must be more than or equals to 4
  - As a value lesser than 4 would not produce any solution for the N-Queens Problem 

Sample output:
